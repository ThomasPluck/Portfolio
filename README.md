This repository covers some of the silly projects that I've done over the years and they cover a few different topics.

- `btc_sde_trader.ipynb` is a Python Jupyter Notebook that reimplements a method for trading cryptocurrencies as function of social media volume using stochastic calculus (sorry, it will not make you rich).

- `element_scraper.py` is a Selenium webscraper that hunts down specific web-elements and takes pictures of them.

- `getcurves.gp` is a PARI/GP script for generating specific Elliptic Curves with an interesting property of trapdoor projection maps onto smaller finite prime order subgroups (interesting consequences for doubling up ElGamal!)

- `gww_drums.ipynb` is a Python Jupyter Notebook that analyzes simulation data from Prof Nils Berglund of Gordon-Webb-Wolpert drums, non-isometric resonance cavities with the same resonance profile.

- `homo_dist.go` is a fun attempt to brute-force LattiGo's CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme to allow two participants to confidentially compute their exact distance along the surface of the earth using the Haversine formula - and learning the upper limits of FHE in the process.

- `reddit_scraper` is a simple BeautifulSoup scraper that can be calibrated to lock onto multiple subreddits and keywords for semantic analysis, either using live submissions or scraping entire subreddits historically.

- `quick-moebius` is a group of Python scripts used for my Bachelor's thesis to learn about the behavior of embedded semigroups in Quasikleinian limit groups.

Some other projects can be found on [my now *dead* undergraduate blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028065156/https://thomaspluck.github.io/).
