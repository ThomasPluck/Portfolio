This repository covers some of the projects that I've done over the years as a student, they cover a few different topics.

- `algo-trader` contains several exploratory data analyses used in an attempt to create an algorithmic trading program. It mostly comprises of EDAs and interesting applications of stochastic and fractional calculus.

- `math-tinkering` contains odd scripts used to play with unusual math ideas that I've had.

- `quick-moebius` is the body of my bachelor's thesis and contains a few algorithms to quickly draw the limit sets of "Quasiklienian semigroups"

- `spectral-stuff` are scripts used to analyze simulations of wave propagation on special domains with unusual spectral characteristics. 

- `web-scrapers` contains a scrapers for downloading all historical data from subreddits and tracking them and taking pictures of web elements.

Some other projects can be found on [my now *dead* undergraduate blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028065156/https://thomaspluck.github.io/).
